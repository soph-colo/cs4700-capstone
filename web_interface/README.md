# Visualization Web Interface
This is a web interface designed to simulate what training looks like in the EmotiveBCI software.
* The accuracy of the model in recognizing commands is dependent upon the user's ability to replicate the same EEG brainwaves used to train each command. When flying the drone, the visual used to train the model is not present, which can have a negative impact on results. Therefore, this interface was created to assist in testing.
* This interface also has the ability to show images for each command, which may aid in training the model. Looking at different images may activate different areas of the brain, making the commands more distinct from one another and improving the reliability of the model.
  * The images folder contains 4 images, one for each command. These image visualizations can be enabled within the code and customized to the user's preference.

## Requirements
* Visual Studio Code (VSCode): Required to run the web interface locally.
* Live Server Extension: Must be installed and enabled in VSCode.
